```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About Us</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This code produces a warning in Next.js 15: `Warning: Each <Link> inside a <Link> needs a unique key prop`. This is because the `Link` component is nested within another `Link` component, and Next.js requires unique keys for each child component to optimize rendering.

The warning itself doesn't directly cause a failure, but it can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior down the line.
